# gpgmailer

gpgmailer is a daemon that sends mail signed and encrypted using GnuPG.  It
reads mail from files containing JSON objects and handles arbitrary
attachments.

Depends on our ConfigHelper library which can be found at
https://github.com/park-bench/confighelper

gpgmailer is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

Bug fixes are welcome.
