# log_level tells GpgMailer how much stuff to report

# gpg_dir should be the gnupg keyring directory containing all of the
# keys you intend to use.  This is not included yet, you should set
# this up yourself first.
gpg_dir=/etc/opt/gpgmailer/gnupg/

# watch_dir sets the directory that gpgmailer checks for new mail objects to
# send.
watch_dir=/tmp/gpgmailer/outbox/

# has ended.

# Sender should be one email address paired with a full PGP key fingerprint.
# For example:

sender=

# signing_key_password is the password for the key you just defined in sender.
#   A password is required.
signing_key_password=

# recipients should be a comma-separated list of address and fingerprint pairs,
# just like sender.  It can be multiline, but it must be indented, like so:

# recipients=test@example.com:5A4228C8D952459F240626EA4289EC280D58338B,
#   test@example.com:5A4228C8D952459F240626EA4289EC280D58338B
